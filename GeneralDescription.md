**# ZOOTROPE_marina**
We will create a Zootrope.
**Explanation:**

We will create a zootrope that will run through a DC motor. This motor will be capable of changing direction and switching
ON/OFF through two buttons. Also, we will have a potientometre that will be capable of changing the speed of the motor. 

This motor will make the zootrope structure spin, so the image in the inside seems to be moving. Also, we will add a LED 
wich will turn green when the motor is ON and red when the motor is OFF.

**Materials:**
1.	1 x Rotary potentiometer.
2.	Arduino Uno R3.
3.  2 x Buttons.
4.  1 x RGB Led.
5.  3 x 220 Ohms resistances.
6.  2 x 10 Kohms resistances.
7.  1 x L2930 Chip.
8.  1 x 9V battery.
9.  Jumper wires.

**Extras:**
The image of the zootrope can be changed (Look in internet!!). 
If the motor is too slow or too fast, just change the 16 in the code (higher number if you need less speed, or lower if
you need more speed).
On the 3D files you have a box to put the circuit inside. There are holes top so the motor, the buttons and the LED are not hidden inside (No photo of this could be uploaded as no 3D printer is available for the moment).
